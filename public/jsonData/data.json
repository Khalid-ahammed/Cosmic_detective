Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but their immense distance from Earth makes them appear as fixed points of light in the sky."

One type of supernova is caused by the “last hurrah” of a dying massive star. This happens when a star at least five times the mass of our sun goes out with a fantastic bang!"
